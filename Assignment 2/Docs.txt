TO SEE JSON RETURNED BY API WHEN GETTING ALL CLIPS: http://api.videogami.co/clips?username=vdgamers&token=7eb1d52ac16ae97b403b58f03b3301d14352e8d641b400a0&count=20&page=0

GOAL: 

	1) Get all clips and animate them as we wish;
	2) Figure out a way to get the appropriate videos on click or something and play 	them to the user and create a button or something to vote.
	3) Play LoL, be happy and get an A.

	Comment made by the professor and found on the assignment's page: "...for this assignment, you are really trying to get a full list of “clips”, not the videos. Clips are transcoded as animated GIFs among other things."

	"The Videogami API is only available for commercial use to registered users.   The C09 group has been assigned a shared API key.    This means that all media going in and out of this account will be seeing by the whole the group.   Exercise good judgement.
